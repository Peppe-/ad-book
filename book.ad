Abstract

Vaadin is an AJAX web application development framework that enables developers to build high-quality user interfaces with Java, both on the server- and client-side. It provides a set of libraries of ready-to-use user interface components and a clean framework for creating your own components. The focus is on ease-of-use, re-usability, extensibility, and meeting the requirements of large enterprise applications.
